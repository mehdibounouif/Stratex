Volatility = how much returns move away from their average.
Small moves → low volatility
Big swings → high volatility
Volatility = standard deviation of returns.

- Step 1: Start with prices:
stock with these daily prices:
| Day | Price |
| --- | ----- |
| 1   | 100   |
| 2   | 102   |
| 3   | 101   |
| 4   | 103   |
| 5   | 104   |

- Step 2: Convert prices → returns:
| Day | Price | Daily Return                |
| --- | ----- | --------------------------- |
| 2   | 102   | (102−100)/100 = **0.0200**  |
| 3   | 101   | (101−102)/102 = **-0.0098** |
| 4   | 103   | (103−101)/101 = **0.0198**  |
| 5   | 104   | (104−103)/103 = **0.0097**  |

- Step 3: Compute the mean (average) return:
sum returns / total returns.
| Asset | Mean Return |
| ----- | ----------- |
| Stock | **0.0099**  |

- Step 4: Calculate deviations from the mean:
Formula: Deviation = Return − Mean
| Day | Return  | Mean   | Deviation   |
| --- | ------- | ------ | ----------- |
| 2   | 0.0200  | 0.0099 | **+0.0101** |
| 3   | -0.0098 | 0.0099 | **-0.0197** |
| 4   | 0.0198  | 0.0099 | **+0.0099** |
| 5   | 0.0097  | 0.0099 | **-0.0002** |

- Step 5: Square the deviations:
Squaring makes all distances positive.
| Day | Deviation | Deviation² |
| --- | --------- | ---------- |
| 2   | +0.0101   | 0.000102   |
| 3   | -0.0197   | 0.000388   |
| 4   | +0.0099   | 0.000098   |
| 5   | -0.0002   | 0.00000004 |

- Step 6: Variance (average squared deviation):
sum of Deviation² / total of Deviation².
0.000588 / 3 = 0.000196.

- Step 7: Volatility (standard deviation):
Volatility is the square root of variance:
σ = 0.014.

Final Result:
| Metric           | Value            |
| ---------------- | ---------------- |
| Daily Volatility | **0.014 (1.4%)** |
